# Welcome to the Aioli Board project

## Problem
In recent years, there have been some truly awesome advances in the quality, quantity, and availability of remotely sensed earth observation data such as imagery from satellites and drones. 

These resources can inform and benefit conservation and environmental projects in radical new ways at both fully global and hyperlocal scales, from monitoring invasive species to detecting zoonotic disease. 

However, we need to understand how the dots connect to use these resources effectively. Specifically, it can be a difficult problem to easily understand 1) what earth observation data is available, where do we find it, and how should we use it? and 2) how does what we see from above the earth connect to what's happening on its surface?

## Solution
The Aioli board is a new Raspberry Pi-compatible Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) component that extends a Raspberry Pi computer to provide data interoperability and remote sensing data discovery tools. 

The Aioli board will make it easier to connect the dots between earth observation data and ground truth conditions in the field, from the field (or in the sea, from the sea!) 

Project guides will provide example implementations for connecting Aioli-enabled Raspberry Pi's with popular IoT platforms and thought leaders.
